Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834), often called simply Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer who fought for the United States in the American Revolutionary War. In 1775, he became convinced that the American cause was noble. In the United States, he was made a major general. He was wounded during the Battle of Brandywine and served with distinction in the Battle of Rhode Island. In 1781, troops in Virginia under his command blocked British forces, leading to the decisive Siege of Yorktown. Lafayette returned to France and was elected a member of the Estates-General of 1789. After the storming of the Bastille, he was made head of the National Guard, and tried to steer a middle course through the French Revolution. In August 1792, the radical factions ordered his arrest. Fleeing through Belgium, he was captured by Austrian troops and spent more than five years in prison. In 1824, President James Monroe invited Lafayette to the United States, where he met a rapturous reception.
